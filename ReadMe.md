# Error Anonymizer

Anonymizes given console error messages (so your user/machine name isn't floating around the internet):

Have you ever pasted your error in a github issue thread or a StackOverflow topic and immediately felt embarrased that your machine name or identifying info was still in the console output?

Well I have, and I wished there was a quick and easy tool to simply redact specific words from the output.


Enter Error Anonymizer!


By feeding this tool a (.txt) file of your given message, and providing the substring to redact, it quickly un-personalizes the error message and returns the message to the user for public submission. 


Very simple tool in scope, but can be quite handy for an ever-expanding group of users!
